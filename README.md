# BikeShare

I have always been an avid user of the bike sharing system in every city I go to. The problem I face when using the bike sharing program is that it is difficult to find where the stations are.

This is an iOS app that solves that problem. It shows the locations of the bike stations in Toronto and provides live data of the available bikes and docks at each station.

All the bike sharing data is provided in live feed JSON format provided by the city of Toronto: http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/stations/json
